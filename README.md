## ⚙️ Setting up Python

To execute Python programs on your computer, you need the **Python Interpreter**.

### Python Interpreter Installation and Setup

1. Visit the official Python website's Downloads page: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Choose the correct Python version for your device.
3. Click the 'Download Python' button.
4. Open the downloaded file and go through the installation process. *(Note: On Windows, ensure you check the box to **"Add Python to PATH"**).*
5. Run the Python IDLE application or use your preferred text editor/IDE.

**Verification:** After installation, verify by running the following command in your Terminal or Command Prompt:
    ```bash
    python --version
    # OR
    python3 --version
    ```
You are now ready to write and execute Python programs.

### Alternative Setup: Using VS Code

If you prefer using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, follow these additional steps for a seamless development experience:

1. **Install VS Code:** Download and install VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Install the Python Extension:** Open VS Code and install the official **Python Extension** developed by Microsoft. This extension provides features like IntelliSense, debugging, and code formatting.
3. **Run Code:** Open a Python file (`.py`) in VS Code and click the **Run** button (a small triangle icon) in the top right corner, or use the shortcut `Ctrl + F5` to execute the script in the integrated terminal.
